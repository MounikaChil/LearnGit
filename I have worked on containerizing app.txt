I have worked on containerizing application using docker and deployed them to kuberentes with CI/CD pipelines


Can you tell me about your current role? 
I have worked on buiding CI/CD pipelines and other MLops related work for deploying ML application. I have work mainly with ML Flow which is an open source application used to maintain ML models. All the ML applications are deployed as API endpoints or Batch job on to kubernetes cluster. 

Do you have experience with AWS?
All our application are deployed to kuberentes both on-prem and on AWS. So I have some experience with AWS also. 

Did you work on Databricks?
I haven't really got a chance to work on it but in my project there are plans to implements MLOps on Databricks but it is still under planning face. Most of the work I have done currently is mostly based on MLFlow and CI/CD pipelines.

Are you familiar with Terraform?
No I haven't really got a chance to work on it but I am familiar with it.
